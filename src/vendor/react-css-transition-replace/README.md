This is a local copy of the `src` directory of the [react-css-transition-replace@4.0.5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-css-transition-replace) package, with the following changes:

- `import React from 'react'` ➡ `import * as React from 'react'`

- `React.Children.only(props.children)` ➡ `props.children` ([why?](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/differences-to-react/#children-api))
